# Description
In this project, my goal was to learn state management for React application using the MobX library. I also employ the following libraries and tools to aid in development

* Webpack - for JS asset build pipeline
* TBA - for hot reloading of code changes during development

In addition I have used TypeScript in order to give better code readability, IDE supported code completion and ease of re-factoring.

# Setup
